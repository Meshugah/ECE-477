	<b><u>About:</u></b>
	I am a graduating senior majoring in computer engineering. In my spare time I enjoy being creative. I have played trumpet for 13 years and I have played in all of the styles of Purdue ensembles from jazz band to orchestra and even my own student lead brass quintet. When not playing trumpet, I like tinkering with electronics, using microcontrollers and designing circuits.
