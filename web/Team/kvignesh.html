	<b><u>About:</u></b>
	Senior in Computer Engineering from India. I enjoy the study of aesthetics and design in my spare time and a big fan of Google's material design. I enjoy weightlifting in my spare time and strongly believe with a better body, the mind has the space it needs to grow. So, I spend most of my free time working on open-source ergonomics projects as it ties my passion of weightlifting to skills that I expect to use in the work environment while I also feel like I’m giving back to the community.

	As much as I like computer architecture, Stack development is what I really enjoy. I’ve always felt a way the education system lacks is in it’s separation of the sciences from the arts which is why I’m glad I’ve found a team with like minded individuals who enjoy hobbies ranging from music to archery. Web and mobile app development helps me fulfil my more artistic tendencies while still being technically relevant.
