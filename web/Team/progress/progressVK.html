            <h2>Progress Report for Vignesh Karthikeyan</h2>
            
            <h4>Week 1:</h4>
            <b>Date:</b> 8/24/17<br>
            <b>Total hours:</b> 6 <br>
            <b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>
            Looked into what kind of backend we would be using and what it would cost to host our project on the web if we needed to. Bought and started using NFC tags that can be reprogammed but cannot write. This lead to the design constraint of needing to use a NFC reader/writer which I had not originally thought was any different from just a reader. 
            </br>

            <br>

            <h4>Week 2:</h4>
            <b>Date:</b> 9/1/17 <br>
            <b>Total hours:</b> 8<br>
            <b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>
 			Setup backup website github incase anything crashes. Starting development of mobile app. Backend chosen was Firebase mBaas just because of our use case. If server side logic becomes needed then I will move it to a NodeJS based stack 
 			</br>
            
			<h4>Week 3:</h4>
            <b>Date:</b> 9/8/17 <br>
            <b>Total hours:</b> 8<br>
            <b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>
 			Looked into enclosure design for components. Aesthetic constraints such as how high the standard lazy susan is was taken into account. Materials considered include Wood which I have talked to the machine lab for and will contact the 3d printing club in knoy if that is an option which it looks like it might be
			. Chosen to not use plexi glass due to it's inability to be machined effectively without lasers. Skins for final customizablity are a strong possibility( waiting for manufacturer to get back to me ) this would give the top the choice of marble, pink marble or granite. The sides would be covered in a thin sheet/sticker of brushed aluminum 
			Following is the computer sketch using Autodesk Inventor of the the top layer to be machined. This was done just to see how many holes we could have and still keep visual appeal and usability. 
			
			Backend has been tested with a simple output input from an android phone. For now, IOS dev will be ruled out but possibilty in the future.
			Following picture is the realtime database initialized with one value being changed.

			<h4>Week 4:</h4>
            <b>Date:</b> 9/15/17 <br>
            <b>Total hours:</b> 6<br>
            <b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>
 			Worked on top cover design for enclosure on autocad to determine what sized base we could use. We used this to also determing optimal hole placing, number of cutouts in total. Setup Autodesk inventor on our assigned school computer. <br><br>

 			Android App has been updated to include NFC, have been succesful in detecting presence and launching app but not able to read/ write data to the tags.
 			<p><img src="https://engineering.purdue.edu/477grp15/Team/progress/images/v_img/NFCstart.png"></img></p> 

 			<br><br>
 			App github is setup here <a href="https://github.com/Meshugah/ECE477">The Amazing SuperSusan</a>
 			<br><br>
 			Wifi Module environment setup to work with arduino programmer. Looking into setting it up with a router.

 			</br>
			

			<h4>Week 5:</h4>
            <b>Date:</b> 9/15/17 <br>
            <b>Total hours:</b> 9<br>
            <b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>
 			CAD design for outer lip was designed and sent to the Boilermaker 3D print labs. Materials available (PBT, ABS and PLS) were researched to meet our criteria of being able to screwed into. I actually could not find any relative information on this so we have decided to use our 25 gram a week free print quota to print on PLS and another account will be setup to test the ABS made available to us by the 477 lab. The design is as seen below. Front cover designed is also displayed below but will be modified to hold the display at an angle.

 			<br><br>
 			NFC was succesfully tested for. and can be detected and can now read. Still don't know how to parse data into meaningful information. Called MIME types and addressed in the documentation here.
 			<a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/connectivity/nfc/nfc.html">MIME TYPES</a>

 			<br><br>
 			ESP8266 wifi module was tested and can now communicate with a custom node based server(not used in our design) to verify ability to work. Was able to write and read data in JSON, connect to a given wifi access point when given SSID and password on reset(with an init.lua file). The scripting for it is done using a language called Lua and is ver NodeJS-esque. Pictures of that

			<h4>Week 6:</h4>
            <b>Date:</b> 9/15/17 <br>
            <b>Total hours:</b> 10<br>
            <b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>
 			Webpage was changed by me to include reports and datasheets have been updated to what they are now. Programming of ESP8266 is now being programmed with Arduino environment made available to us via a GitHub Library. Communication with ESP8266 and Android application is established. This is through both of them writting through to the same database(firebase). This took a lot of time so this is all i have to show for this week. 
 			<p><img width=700px src="https://engineering.purdue.edu/477grp15/Team/progress/images/v_img/fbaseESP.png"></img></p>
 			<br>
 			The reason for the delay for this was trying to use a web based API to make this communication possible. This along with moving programming environments from Lua script to the Arduino programming environment, which I am also not familiar with made this hard to. This made sense as a move to this development environment would mean more support from the community. I have looked extensively into Setting up an AWS EC2 instance to run our server on when I can set up our project to work wirelessly. Until then, prototyping will remain on firebase which is very convenient for our quick setup and testing now as it builds confidence for the team when things work.

 			<br><br>
 			Looking into barcode API stuff. Given the progress I have made so far, I want to go full steam and try and get all of it done by week 8. What I really want to do is build my own backend using NodeJS and Express using a style similar to <a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/connectivity/nfc/nfc.html">this</a>.

 			
 			<h4>Week 7:</h4>
            <b>Date:</b> 10/6/17 <br>
            <b>Total hours:</b> 13<br>
            <b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>
 			This week was mostly R&D for our MEAN stack I have been working on a ExpressJS based server and this has been eventful.<p><img width=700px src="https://engineering.purdue.edu/477grp15/Team/progress/images/v_img/express.png"></img></p>
 			<br>
 			I have been following a tutorial from UDEMY and am about 60%percent done with it since the start of the semester

 			<br><br>
 			Ziad has a picture of the PCB front plate that we both helped soldering. It was my very first time soldering such small components so please excuse the shoddy work(lead-less solder did not help). 
 			<br><br>
 			I was working on the software formalization this week so there is not a lot to show. I should have a lot more done this following week once I get more comfortable with ExpressJS and setting up our MongoDB. 



			<h4>Week 9:</h4>
            <b>Date:</b> 10/19/17 <br>
            <b>Total hours:</b> 10<br>
            <b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>
 			This has been a particularly slow week due to external circumstances(interviews) for me at least. Ziad and I have been wrestling to setup the ESP and the STM32's SPI communication. The SPI libraries(slave operation) for the SPI are non-existant as of now but I have been working with multiple projects I have found online and have managed to put together something that is reasonably reliable. Testing it now and we have errors in communication.
 			<br><br>
 			One of our ESP8266s got fried by Ziad as he connected the PWM line to it and it smoked up. We haven't tested it since but I'm pretty sure smoke is a good indicator of it's usefulness now. 
 			<br><br>
 			API for barcode implementation is coming along smoothly. Can now(rarely) detect the presence of a barcode. I've got a really bad phone I bought on amazon for 30$ that I have to use until I get my next one and the camera is just bad. So I'm putting a hold on the progress updates on that until Oct 30th. 
 			<br><br>
 			AWS: Server implementation is to be on AWS on an EC2 t2.nano instance (now setup). Cognito is being setup but I am trying to understand roles(looks like you can grant different users different permission, Not everyone can write to database). Since Firebase is noSql, I am considering DynamoDb(I've already started trying to get it to work).

 			<h4>Week 10:</h4>
            <b>Date:</b> 10/19/17 <br>
            <b>Total hours:</b> 14<br>
            <b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>
 			Struggle with SPI has proven to be too much to the poin that It has derailed me from doing more of my software work. I have thus put it on hold and I beleive Ziad, my partner for getting it to work has also put it on hold. 
 			<br><br>
 			On better notes. Our firebase JSON is Coming together to store multiple entries. I have not written a lot of actual code but I hope this is not interpretted as not putting in work. I'm planning ahead so I don't make mistakes later. I am following the scalability guidelines given<a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/android/structure-data"> here</a>
 			<br><br>
 			Our 3D printing has been a bunch of hilarious mistakes. I'm glad I tried printing so early. This is our 4th time trying. The first one just got out right cancelled. The second time did too. So i went into lab and saw the hold process through rather than remotely. It turned out about double the size on possible dimensions. Our guess is that it is because of the inch to cm conversion being 2.54 so we scaled our design to 34% to see if that fixes and we are yet to hear if that works. We used the same IPT file to acheive this as pictured below:
 			the display at an angle.

 			<br><br>
 			The physical prints came in today. I am currenly phoneless and developing using the emulator. 
            <br><br>
            The photos of our existing 3D printed part is as shown below
